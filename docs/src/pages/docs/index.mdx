GraphQL Debugger is a platform for debugging your GraphQL Server. You can use debugger locally as described below or you can build your own [adapter](/docs/components/adapters) to host your own GraphQL Debugger.

To learn why you need a specific GraphQL debugging tool, see [Why GraphQL Debugging ?](/docs/why).

Curious how GraphQL Debugger works? See [How it works](/docs/how).

## Debugger Components

There are few components that make up GraphQL Debugger:

- [Open Telemetry Collector](/docs/components/collector).
- [GraphQL Debugger UI](/docs/components/ui).
- [GraphQL Debugger Backend](/docs/components/backend).
- [GraphQL Debugger Client SDK's](/docs/packages/trace-schema).

Mostly developers interact with [GraphQL Debugger UI](/docs/components/ui) and Client SDK's. [The Open Telemetry Collector](/docs/components/collector) is a component that collects data from your GraphQL Server and sends it to the GraphQL Debugger Backend.

## Running debugger locally

To get started run the [GraphQL Debugger CLI](/docs/packages/cli). This will start the [Collector](/docs/components/collector), [Backend](/docs/components/backend) and [UI](/docs/components/ui) for you. You can install and run it with one command:

```sh
npx graphql-debugger

# Collector Online, send traces to http://localhost:4318/v1/traces.

# Debugger Online, visit http://localhost:16686 to view traces.
```

Now you will be able to access [GraphQL Debugger UI](/docs/components/ui) at http://localhost:16686

## Connecting your server

Once debugger is running you can use our open source packages to connect your GraphQL Server to GraphQL Debugger.

### GraphQL JS

```ts
import { AdapterProxy } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy";
import { DebuggerClient } from "@graphql-debugger/client";
import { traceSchema } from "@graphql-debugger/trace-schema";

import { GraphQLSchema } from "graphql";

const schema: GraphQLSchema = __YOUR_SCHEMA__;

const adapter = new AdapterProxy();

const client = new DebuggerClient({
  adapter,
});

const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
  schema,
  client,
});
```

### GraphQL Yoga

```ts
import { AdapterProxy } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy";
import { DebuggerClient } from "@graphql-debugger/client";
import {
  GraphQLDebuggerContext,
  traceSchema,
} from "@graphql-debugger/trace-schema";

import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const adapter = new AdapterProxy();

const client = new DebuggerClient({
  adapter,
});

const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
  schema,
  client,
});

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: tracedSchema,
  context: (req) => {
    return {
      GraphQLDebuggerContext: new GraphQLDebuggerContext(),
    };
  },
});
```
