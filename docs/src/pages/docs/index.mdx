# Quick start

GraphQL Debugger is a platform for debugging your GraphQL Server. You can use debugger locally as described below or you can build your own [adapter](/docs/components/adapters) to host your own GraphQL Debugger.

To learn why you need a specific GraphQL debugging tool, see [Why GraphQL Debugging ?](/docs/why).


## Debugger Components

There are few components that make up GraphQL Debugger:

- Open Telemetry Collector
- GraphQL Debugger UI
- GraphQL Debugger Client SDK's

For the most part you will only need to interact with GraphQL Debugger UI and Client SDK's. The Open Telemetry Collector is a component that collects data from your GraphQL Server and sends it to GraphQL Debugger UI. You can read more about Open Telemetry Collector in TODO.

## Running debugger locally

GraphQL Debugger cli is a tool that allows you to run GraphQL Debugger locally. It will start the Open Telemetry Collector and GraphQL Debugger UI for you. You can install and run it with:

```sh
npx graphql-debugger

# Collector Online, send traces to http://localhost:4318/v1/traces.

# Debugger Online, visit http://localhost:16686 to view traces.
```

Now you will be able to access GraphQL Debugger UI at http://localhost:16686

## Connecting your server

Once debugger is running you can use our open source packages to connect your GraphQL Server to GraphQL Debugger. 


### GraphQL JS
TODO VERIFY

```ts
import { DebuggerClient } from "@graphql-debugger/client";
import { AdapterProxy } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy";
import { traceSchema } from "@graphql-debugger/trace-schema";
import { GraphQLSchema } from "graphql";

const schema: GraphQLSchema = __YOUR_SCHEMA__;

const adapter = new AdapterProxy();

const client = new DebuggerClient({
  adapter,
});

const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
    schema,
    client,
});
```

### GraphQL Yoga

TODO VERIFY

```ts
import { DebuggerClient } from "@graphql-debugger/client";
import { AdapterProxy } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy";
import { traceSchema, GraphQLDebuggerContext } from "@graphql-debugger/trace-schema";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const adapter = new AdapterProxy();

const client = new DebuggerClient({
  adapter,
});

const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
  schema,
  client,
});

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: tracedSchema,
  context: (req) => {
    return {
      GraphQLDebuggerContext: new GraphQLDebuggerContext(),
    };
  },
});
```
