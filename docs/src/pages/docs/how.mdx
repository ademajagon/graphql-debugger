# How GraphQL Debugger Works ?

GraphQL Debugger is a collection of integratable components when composed together provides a complete debugging solution for GraphQL.

Leverging Open Telemetry and Open Source standards, GraphQL Debugger provides a way to instrument GraphQL servers and clients to collect and visualize the traces.


## Trace Directive

When debugging a GraphQL API you have to ask yourself, what do you want to trace ? Do you want all of the fields to be traced or just a few of them ? GraphQL Debugger provides a way to trace only the fields you want to trace and this directive sits at the heart of GraphQL Debugger.

```graphql
directive @trace on FIELD_DEFINITION
```

You can apply the directive on either a GraphQL **Query** or **Mutation**.

<Tabs items={['query', 'mutation']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```graphql
type Query {
        users: [User!]! @trace
}
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```graphql
type Mutation {
        createPost: Post! @trace
}
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>  
</Tabs>

Or on a GraphQL Field: 


```graphql
type User {
    name: String! 
    email: String! 
    balance: String! @trace # <--- Trace this field because its complex
}
```

Once applied, __and picked up by your graphql runtime__, the trace directive will essentally wrap that resolver and collect instrumentation data.



<Tabs items={['Before @trace', 'With @trace']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```ts
async function resolver() {
        const user = await getUserFromDb();
        return user;
}
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```ts
async function trace() { // <-- trace wrapper function is added by the directive
        async function resolver() {
            const user = await getUserFromDb();
            return user;
        }

        const span = tracer.startSpan('query user');

        const result = await span.trace(resolver);

        span.end();

        return result;
} 
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>  
</Tabs>


The pitfall with using the trace directive approch is that you have to manually add the directive to each field you want to trace plus there is some boilerplate code you have to add to enable the directive at runtime. You can learn more about the directive [here](/docs/packages/trace-directive).

## Trace Schema

Using the trace schema lib you can automatically add the trace directive to your schema and enable tracing for all fields. This is a great way to get started with tracing your GraphQL API.

```ts
import { traceSchema } from '@graphql-debugger/trace-schema';
import { DebuggerClient } from '@graphql-debugger/client';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';

const typeDefs = `
    type Query {
        users: [User!]!
    }

    type User {
        name: String!
        email: String!
        balance: String!
    }
`;

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers: {
        Query: {
            users: () => [{...}]
        }
    }
});

// Schema with tracing applied to all fields
const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
    schema,
    client: DebuggerClient // <-- See Client and Adapters
});
```


<Tabs items={['Before traceSchema', 'With traceSchema']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```gql
    type Query {
        users: [User!]!
    }

    type User {
        name: String!
        email: String!
        balance: String!
    }
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    <pre>
      ```gql
    directive @trace on FIELD_DEFINITION

    type Query {
        users: [User!]! @trace
    }

    type User {
        name: String! @trace
        email: String! @trace
        balance: String! @trace
    }
```
    </pre>
  </Tabs.Tab>  
</Tabs>

### Schema Exporter

When using Trace Schema, in the background, the schema will be hashed and exported to the Collector. This is done so that the Collector can identify the schema and provide a way to visualize the traces, you can disable it by passing `shouldExportSchema: false` to the `traceSchema` function.

```ts
const tracedSchema = traceSchema({
    schema,
    shouldExportSchema: false // <-- Disable schema export
});
```

## Collector

The collector is a service that listens for the traces proporgated from the GraphQL API and stores them in a database. It contains endpoints that ingest the schema, traces and spans. 


### Schema Endpoint
*  `/v1/schema`


### Traces Endpoint
* `/v1/traces`
